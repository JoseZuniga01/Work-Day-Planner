# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
create a work day schedular that uses regular work hours and time blocks change colors depending on the time of day of for the task. Past, present, and future. 
# Fix HTML code 
First stated by created a proper file structure for all the code. I then correctly linked the JS and style sheet to the HTML code
# add time blocks to HTML
needed to add the basic 9-5 work schedule time blocks to the HTML + create a new class for them I can later call out for styling and functionality 
# created global variables for JS 
created variables to call out through my script and place them on the top of the sheet 
# set up local storage 
needed a local storage to store user input data. the client wants the scedular to be able to save tasks when page reloads. 
# Add function for time blacks 
time blocks need to be interactive to show time of day per task according to the time of day. pulling info from moment.js we will color coordinate the blocks with grey, red, and green to signal past, present, future tasks 
# pull from local stroage 
pull user data from the local storage we set up and place in appropriate time block container we created in the HTML 
# add functioality to save button 
add save functionality to the save button in each time block container. When user inputs task and clicks save. Task is saved even if page refresh
